### Problem Statement
https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe

Our problem will be based on this game, 'Ultimate Tic Tac Toe'. The game consists of 3x3 grid of standard Tic-Tac-Toe boards. The game starts on any small board. In each move, a player can play in any board. A board is won when a player wins three in a row, column or diagonal in a local 3x3 board. The game is won by securing three local boards in a row, column or diagonal. We aim to build a bot to play this game as optimal as possible against agents on [Codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe)
